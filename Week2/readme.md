4.  Notes
## Hands On Project
1.  import date class from datetime module
2.  create the date object of today's date and legal age requirement variable
3.  collecting user input regarding their first and last name along with their current age
4.  create a function that calculates the difference between legal age and current age and then returns a value
5.  print user information ensuring to capitalize user's first and last name using the f function. 
    *   The user's age should also be printed on the same sentence
6.  Develop an if statement to determine if the user is too young to run for president
7.  If the user is old enough, you should print a statement that states "You are old enough to run for president"
8.  If the user is not old enough, you should develop an else statement that calls a function to determine the age gap and then print the following
9.  Wait until you turn (legal age variable) years old to run for the office of President. 
    *    Which should be in about (function variable) years from (today's date variable)
