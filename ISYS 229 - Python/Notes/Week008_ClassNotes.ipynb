    "1. List\n",
    "\t1. Data structure that holds ordered collections of related data. \n",
    "\t2. Known as arrays in other languages.\n",
    "\t3. Properties:\n",
    "\t\t1. Are ordered: items have a defined order, and that order will not change\n",
    "\t\t2. If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.\n",
    "\t\t3. Contain objects of arbitrary types.\n",
    "\t\t4. Elements can be accessed by index.\n",
    "\t\t5. Are arbitrarily nestable.\n",
    "\t\t6. Have variable sizes.\n",
    "\t\t7. Are mutable: we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.\n",
    "2. Tuple\n",
    "\t1. Holds together multiple related objects.\n",
    "\t2. Are immutable.\n",

    "## Tuple\n",
    "1. Advantages of tuples over lists:\n",
    "\t1. Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n",
    "\t2. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable). \n",
    "\t\t1. Meaning we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created. \n",
    "\t3. Written with round brackets.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "thistuple = (\"apple\",\"banana\",\"cherry\")\n",
    "print(thistuple)\n",
    "```\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ">>> ('apple','banana','cherry')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "thistuple = (\"apple\",\"banana\",\"cherry\")\n",
    "print(thistuple)\n",
    "```\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ">>> <class 'tuple'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuple Syntax\n",
    "1. Advantages of tuples over lists:\n",
    "\t1. Are better suited for use with different (heterogeneous) data types.\n",
    "\t2. Can be used as key for dictionary.\n",
    "\t3. Iterating over tuples is faster.\n",
    "\t4. Are better for passing around data that you don’t want changed.\n",
    "2. Consists of individual values separated by commas.\n",
    "3. Create using parentheses.\n",
    "Syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> one = 'thing'\n",
    ">>> one\n",
    "('thing',)\n",
    ">>> type(one)\n",
    "<class 'tuple'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lesson 5.5.1\n",
    "## Indexing\n",
    "1. Can use index operator, [], to access element in tuple. \n",
    "2. Indices start at zero.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "thistuple = (\"apple\",\"banana\",\"cherry\")\n",
    "print(thistuple[1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ">>> banana\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lesson 5.5.2\n",
    "## Slicing\n",
    "1. Allows you to access subset of tuple.\n",
    "2. General syntax:\n",
    "```tupleToSlice [Start index (included):Stop index (excluded):Increment]```\n",
    "\t1. Start index: \n",
    "\t\t1. Index at which to start slicing. If excluded, zero is default.\n",
    "\t\t2. This element is included in slice. \n",
    "\t2. Stop index:\n",
    "\t\t1. Index at which to stop slicing.\n",
    "\t\t2. This element is excluded in slice.\n",
    "\t3. Increment:\n",
    "\t4. Determines steps to take. If excluded, one is default.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "thistuple = (\"apple\",\"banana\",\"cherry\",\"orange\",\"kiwi\",\"melon\",\"mango\")\n",
    "print(thistuple[2:5])\n",
    ">>> ('cherry','orange','kiwi')\n",
    "#This will return the items from position 2-5\n",
    "#first item = 0\n",
    "#postion 5 not included\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lesson 5.6\n",
    "## Tuple Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. any(tuple) \n",
    "\t1. Used to discover whether any element is iterable. \n",
    "\t2. Returns Boolean.\n",
    "2. count(item)\n",
    "\t1. Returns number of occurrences of item in tuple. \n",
    "3. min(tuple)\n",
    "\t1. Returns smallest element.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "thistuple = (5,1,3,5,7,8,7,5,4,6,8,5)\n",
    "x = thistuple.count(5)\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    ">>>4\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. max(tuple) \n",
    "\t1. Returns largest element.\n",
    "5. len(tuple)\n",
    "\t1. Returns total number of elements.\n",
    "6. + \n",
    "\t1. Used for concatenation; used in same way as lists\n",
    "Ex. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "thistuple = tuple((\"apple\",\"banana\",\"cherry\"))\n",
    "print(len(thistuple))\n",
