## Learning Objectives
1.  Define the term “pseudocode” as a generalized description of a program
2.  Define the term “flowchart” as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm.
3.  Define a decision table as a grid of rows and columns used to distill a set of complex decisions and actions into a set of rules that can become the statements in a computer program.
## Hands On Project
### Exercise 1
1.  Exercise 1 Description:
    1. [Python File](HandsOn/Proj1/Proj1.py)
    2. [Psudocode](HandsOn/Proj1/Psudocode.md)

### Exercise 2
1.  Exercise 2 Files:
    1. [Python File](HandsOn/Proj2/Proj2.py)
    2. [Psudocode](HandsOn/Proj2/Psudocode.md)
2.  Exercise 2 Description:
    1.  For your second activity, you will need to use the information that you’ve learned so far and provide the outcomes based on the following listed requirements.
    2.  Develop a program which asks the user to enter three separate whole numbers
    3.  Based on the information provided, the program will need to add the numbers together
    4.  Once the numbers are added together, there should be an output that states “Based on the information provided, you total is” {variable name}
### Exercise 3
1.  Exercise 3 Files:
    1. [Python File](HandsOn/Proj3/Proj3.py)
    2. [Psudocode](HandsOn/Proj3/Psudocode.md)
2.  Exercise 3 Description:
    1.  For your third activity, you will need to use the information that you’ve learned so far and provide the outcomes based on the following listed requirements.
    2.  Develop a program which asks for the user’s first name, last name, and age.
    3.  Based on the user’s age decide if the user meets the age requirement to run for the office of president, (Google the age requirement if you have to).
    4.  If the user is old enough, the program should output their full name along with their current age, and tell them good luck with their race for the presidency.
    5.  If they are not old enough, the program should output their full name along with their current age, and mention that they are not old enough to run for the presidency.
