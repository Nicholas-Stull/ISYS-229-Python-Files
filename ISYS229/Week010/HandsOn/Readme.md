# Week 10

## Assigment 
This week, you will have the option the develop two separate programs. You may choose option A or option B.
### To do list:
### Option A: 
1.	Create a program that performs the following…
    1.	Create input statements that will take in a student’s first name, last name, major, and the amount of school credits they’ve taken so far.
    2.	Declare a Student class. Within the class develop the following attributes
        1.	Define an init method with the following attributes:
            1.	First name, last name, major, and credits
        2.	Define a method that will take the amount of school credits taken and determine if the student is eligible to schedule their It internship.	
    3.	Instantiate a new object using the Student class by passing the inputs that the user typed in.
    4.	Display the user’s first and last name capitalized. Show them the major and the amount of credits they just typed in.
    5.	Call the instantiated object using the method to determine if they are eligible to schedule their internship
2.	Make sure to provide a flowchart and pseudocode for this program. Along with the program file Module7_lastname.py.
3.	The end result should look similar to the following…

	5. Add the main event loop
2.	If you decide to perform option B, you do not have to perform a flowchart pseudocode. You will only be responsible for uploading a completed .py file. Make sure to label it Module7_lastname.py 
3.	The output should look similar to this
