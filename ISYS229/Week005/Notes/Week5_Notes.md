## Lesson 2.2.1:
### String Operations and Methods
1.  Strings are sequence of characters.
2.  Can be enclosed in either double or single quotes. 
3.  Double-quoted string can contain single quotes.
4.  Single-quoted string can contain double quotes.
5.  Can use triple quotes (''' or """) to build multiline string.
6.  Can use * operator to repeat strings.
    1. ```Example: print('Alibaba and the', 'thieves '* 40)```
7. Can use + to concatenate stings.
    1. ```Example: "I " + "love " + "Python"```
8.  Strings are immutable: unable to be changed
9.  Strings can be indexed.
10. First character is at index 0

## Lesson 2.2.2:
### Indexing
1.  Indexing is used to access individual characters in a string.
2.  Indexing is zero-based.
3.  Indexing can be done from the beginning of the string or from the end of the string.
4.  Indexing can be done using square brackets.
5.  Indexing can be done using negative numbers.
6.  Indexing can be used to access individual characters in a string.
7.  Indexing can be used to access a range of characters in a string.

## Lesson 2.2.3:
### Slicing
1.  Slicing is used to access a range of characters in a string.
2.  Slicing can be done using square brackets.
3.  Slicing can be done using negative numbers.
4.  Slicing can be used to access a range of characters in a string.

Example
```python
Syntax: string[start_index: end_index]
```

## Lesson 2.2.4:
### Length
1. Length determined by number of characters inside string.
2. Get length with built-in len function1.  
3. Length is determined by the number of characters inside a string.
4. Get length with built-in len function.

## Lesson 2.2.5:
### String Formatting
1.  String formatting is used to insert values into a string.
2.  String formatting can be done using the % operator.
3. String Interpolation• Process of evaluating string that has placeholders.
4. f-strings (formatted strings) are used

## Lesson 2.2.6:
### String Methods
1.  String methods are used to manipulate strings.
    1. ```str.capitalize()```
        1. Returns copy of string with first letter capitalized.• last_name = input("Type your last name: ")• print(last_name.capitalize())• >>> Clayborn
    2. ```str.lower()```
        1. Returns copy of string with first letter capitalized.
    3. str.upper()
        1. Returns copy of string with first letter capitalized.
    4. str.startswith()
        1. Returns Boolean after checking whether string starts with specified prefix.
    5. str.endswith()
        1. Returns Boolean after checking whether string ends with specified suffix.
    6. str.strip()
        1. Returns copy with leading and trailing spaces removed.
    7.str.replace()
        1. Returns copy with all occurrences of specified substring replaced with new one.

## Lesson 2.3:
### Lists
1.  Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
2.  Lists are created using square brackets.
3.  Lists can contain items of different types.
4.  Lists can contain duplicate items.

1. In Pythob Arrays are Knonw as Lists
2. Lists are aggregate data types, which means they are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
3. Some Characteristics of Lists
    1. Lists are mutable
    2. Lists are ordered
    3. Lists are indexed
    4. Lists can contain duplicate values
    5. Lists can contain values of different data types
4. Concatenation
    1. ```Example: [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]```
5. Repetition
    1. ```Example: ['Hi!'] * 4```
6. Membership
    1. ```Example: 3 in [1, 2, 3]```
7. Iteration
    1. ```Example: for x in [1, 2, 3]: print(x)```

## Lesson 2.4:
### Booleans
1.  Booleans are used to represent truth values.
2.  Booleans are created using the bool function.
3. True or False are the only two values of the bool type.

## Lesson 2.4.1:
### Comparison Operators
1.  Comparison operators are used to compare values.   
2.  Comparison operators return a Boolean value.
3.  Comparison operators can be used to compare numbers.
4. <: less than
5. >: greater than
6. <=: less than or equal to
7. >=: greater than or equal to
8. ==: equal to
9. !=: not equal to
