    "# Lesson 7.1\n",
    "\n",
    "##  A First Look at OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "1.       Object-oriented programming (OOP): Programming paradigm based on concept of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.       Objects: Capsules of properties and procedures/methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.       Allows us to abstract actual code and think more about attributes of data and operations around data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.       Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.       Code reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.       Easier to design software as you can model it in terms of real-world objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.       Easier to test, debug, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.       Data is secure due to abstraction and data hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lesson 7.2\n",
    "\n",
    "## OOP in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1.       Classes are OOP building-blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.       Blueprints for objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.       Everything in Python is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.       Running type function on any object will reveal class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lesson 7.2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a Class in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1.       Syntax is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)      class ClassName\n",
    "\n",
    "2)      type function shows class type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)      In Python, class and type are synonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.       Class: blueprint\n",
    "\n",
    "3.       Attributes: noun, parts of the object\n",
    "\n",
    "4.       Methods: action, things the object does\n",
    "\n",
    "5.       Instantiation: copies of the class\n",
    "\n",
    "6.       Declaring the Employee Class\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "```class Employee:\n",
    "def _ _ init _ _(self, fname, lname, age):\n",
    "\tself.fname = fname\n",
    "\tself.lname = lname\n",
    "\tself.age = age\n",
    "def fullname (self):\n",
    "print(f”Hello {self.fname} {self.lname}, you are {self.age} years old.”)\n",
    "emp_1 = Employee(‘Eric’, ‘Clayborn’, 23) emp_1.fullname()\n",
    "emp_2 = Employee(‘Andrew’, ‘Churchill’, 25) emp_2.fullname()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7.       Developing the Attributes (nouns)\n",
    "\n",
    "1)      Each method within a class automatically takes the instance as the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)      Always call it “self”\n",
    "\n",
    "3)      Create method containing self using a print statement to display full name and age\n",
    "\n",
    "4)      Call the methods in order to display the actions or results\n",
    "\n",
    "5)      Notice the ( ) located at the end, because it is a method being called rather than an attribute being passed\n",
    "\n",
    "6)      This displays the return value of the method"
